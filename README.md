# Hi, I'm Harsh! 👋

### Software Engineer | MS CS Student at University of Florida

I am a Software Developer with a strong background in **Frontend Engineering** and **Full Stack Development**. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's at UF to bridge the gap between traditional software engineering and **Applied AI/ML**.

My goal is to build intelligent applications that look great and solve complex problems.
